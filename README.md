A simple banner ad system that allowed our company to place paid banner ads on
our web properties. Circa late 1990s.

Features included multiple banner ad locations, clickthrough tracking,
purchasable ad impressions count, client (advertiser) login for statistics
viewing, and an email reminder when an ad is nearing completion of its run.
